	 * Question: Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
	 *
	 * Solution: Traverse the linked list from the beginning, and use int i to track which index
	 * 			 you are on. If i = index (which is size() - k), cout, then break. Else, i++
	 *
	 * Complexity: O(n) for the one loop
	 *
